# Web-Design-Challenge

##Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

This web design challenge is to employ html, css, and bootstrap to visualize the weather analysis performed in my previous project: https://github.com/mvongjesda/Python-API-Challenge
            
            
Utlizing OpenWeatherMap's API, weather from a random set of >500 cities were compared in their latitudes along with temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speeds. Data was plotted using the pandas and Matplotlib Python library, and the analysis is now hosted here.

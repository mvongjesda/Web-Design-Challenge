            <p>Utlizing OpenWeatherMap's API weather from a random set of >500 cities were compared in their latitudes with temperature. The temperatures were higher when the city's location was closer to the equator (latitude at 0 degrees).  Also, this study was conducted in the winter in the northern hemisphere, and temperatures were more prevalent to fall below freezing when the cities were located farther north (latitude >40), especially compared to the much hotter summer temperatures in the southern hemisphere (negative latitudes). </p>
